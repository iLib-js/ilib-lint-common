    /**
     * Parse the current file into an intermediate representation. This
     * representation may be anything you like, as long as the rules you
     * implement also can use this same format to check for problems.<p>
     *
     * Many parsers produce an abstract syntax tree. The tree could have
     * a different style depending on the programming language, but
     * generally, each node has a type, a name, and an array of children,
     * as well as additional information that depends on the type of
     * the node.<p>
     *
     * Other types of intermediate representation could include:<p>
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>lines - just split the file into an array of lines in order
     * <li>string - treat the whole file like a big string
     * <li>concrete syntax tree - a tree the represents the actual
     *   syntactical elements in the file. This can be converted to
     *   an abstract syntax tree afterwards, which would be more useful
     *   for checking for problems.
     * <li>resources - array of instances of Resource classes as
     *   defined in {@link https://github.com/ilib-js/ilib-tools-common}.
     *   This is the preferred intermediate representation for
     *   resource files like Java properties or xliff files. There are many
     *   rules that already know how to process Resource instances that
     *   can apply equally well to resources from any resource file type.
     * </ul>
     *
     * There are occasions when the parser itself can produce errors:
     *
     * <ul>
     * <li>incorrect or unknown character set
     * <li>incorrect encoding of the given character set
     * <li>syntax error in the file which prevents proper parsing
     * <li>i/o errors while reading the file (for example, an unsatisfied
     *   symbolic link)
     * </li>
     *
     * In these cases, this method should throw a ParseException and
     * attach one or more Result instance to the exception which can be
     * reported back to the user via the normal formatters.
     *
     * @abstract
     * @returns {IntermediateRepresentation} the intermediate representation
     * @throws {ParseException} if there are errors while parsing the file
     */

     * <li>string - the parser doesn't parse. Instead, it just treats the
     *   the file as one long string.
